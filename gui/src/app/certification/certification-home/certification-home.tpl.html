<h2><i class="fa fa-paper-plane-o"></i> Testing by Criteria Home</h2>

<p>This area provides test case listings that are organized by and correspond to the 2015 Edition criteria. Select the criteria on the menu bar to see the available ETT test cases for that criteria. Note that the listings here are only the tool-based tests--not a comprehensive list of the required tests for each criterion.  Please refer to the 2015 Edition Test Procedures and Certification Companion Guides link found in the "Documents" section.
