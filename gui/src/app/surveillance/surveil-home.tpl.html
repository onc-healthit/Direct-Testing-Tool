<h2><i class="fa fa-paper-plane-o"></i> Surveillance: Context-free Transport Testing</h2>

<p>
    The transport tests in this surveillance area support in-the-field, real-world verification of your system to three specified 2015 Edition certification criteria that include transport standards conformance. These tests can be executed on an ad-hoc basis and do not require any specific data.
</p>

<h2><i class="caption glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt"></i> Context-free C-CDA Conformance Testing Options</h2>

<p>
This surveillance does not test "content." Therefore, any C-CDA content included as part of these tests will not be reviewed. The C-CDA Scorecard found at <a ng-href="http://www.healthit.gov/scorecard" target="_blank">www.healthit.gov/scorecard</a> can be used for context-free/non-certification based testing. The C-CDA Scorecard uses best practices and quantitative scoring criteria developed by HL7 to improve the C-CDA's implementation consistency.
</p>
<p>
Testing both C-CDA content and Direct protocol transport can be done via production settings using the ONC One Click Scorecard benchmarking utility by sending a C-CDA to <a href="mailto:scorecard@direct.hhs.gov" target="_blank">scorecard@direct.hhs.gov</a>
</p>
